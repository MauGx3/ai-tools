# Example: Starred Repository Analysis

This document demonstrates the complete workflow for analyzing starred repositories using the AI-powered scanner.

## Step 1: Raw Repository Data

After running `python scripts/scan_starred_repos.py`, you get structured metadata:

```json
{
  "scan_date": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "total_repositories": 3,
  "username": "example_user",
  "repositories": [

    }
  ]
}
```

## Step 2: AI Analysis Using Repository Analyzer Prompt

For each repository, we use the [Repository Analyzer prompt](../_prompts/repository-analyzer.md) to generate enhanced insights.

## Step 3: Organized Output

The final result is a comprehensive database of your starred repositories with:

### Summary Statistics
- **Total Repositories**: 3
- **Languages**: JavaScript (1), Rust (1), Python (1)
- **Categories**: Frontend Framework (1), Programming Language (1), Web Framework (1)
- **Average Stars**: 132,667

### Searchable Categories

**Frontend Development**
- facebook/react - Component-based UI library for web and native apps

**Systems Programming**
- rust-lang/rust - Memory-safe systems language with zero-cost abstractions

**Backend Development**
- django/django - Full-stack Python web framework for rapid development

### By Use Case

**Building Web Applications**
- facebook/react (Frontend)
- django/django (Backend)

**High-Performance Systems**
- rust-lang/rust (Systems programming)

**API Development**
- django/django (REST APIs)
- facebook/react (Frontend for APIs)

## Step 4: Practical Applications

### Use Case 1: Project Planning
When starting a new web project, search for "web-framework" and "ui-framework" to quickly identify React + Django as a potential stack.

### Use Case 2: Learning Path
For learning systems programming, identify Rust repositories and extract relevant use cases and integration points.

### Use Case 3: Team Recommendations
Share categorized lists with team members to standardize on technology choices.

### Use Case 4: Discovery
Find forgotten tools you starred years ago that solve current problems.

## Benefits Demonstrated

1. **Enhanced Descriptions**: AI provides context beyond GitHub's default descriptions
2. **Actionable Keywords**: Specific, searchable terms for filtering
3. **Real Use Cases**: Concrete applications instead of abstract descriptions
4. **Better Organization**: Category-based grouping with difficulty levels
5. **Integration Insights**: Understanding how tools work together

## Next Steps

1. Run the scanner on your full starred list
2. Analyze repositories in batches using the AI prompt
3. Build a searchable database or documentation site
4. Set up automated weekly scans for new stars
5. Share curated lists with your team
