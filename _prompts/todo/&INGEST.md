* Explain this **[Code Snippet, Library function, or RegEx]** to me like I'm a developer who just started their first internship. Break down the core logic in one sentence, then list exactly what it takes as input and what it returns as output.
* Give me 3 different, high-level technical concerns I should raise about this plan: [Describe the Plan, e.g., 'Moving our $auth$ logic from $microservice$ A to $microservice$ B']. Format each concern as a professional-sounding, one-sentence quote that starts with: "We need to consider..."
* Write a boilerplate [Language, e.g., $Java$ class, $TypeScript$ interface, $Python$ function] that implements [Goal, e.g., 'a data structure for a User object with name, email, and ID', 'a basic endpoint handler for a $GET$ request']. Do not include any business logic, just the standard structure and required type definitions.
