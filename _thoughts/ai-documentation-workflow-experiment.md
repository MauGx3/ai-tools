description: "Experiment with using AI to automate and improve documentation workflows"
---

I've been experimenting with using AI tools to streamline the documentation process for technical projects. The goal is to reduce
the manual effort while maintaining high-quality, comprehensive documentation.

## Background

Traditional documentation workflows often suffer from:
- Time-consuming manual writing
- Inconsistent formatting and style
- Outdated information due to maintenance overhead
- Poor discoverability and organization

I wanted to test whether AI could help address these issues while maintaining quality standards.

## Experiment Setup

### Tools Used
1. **AI Writing Assistant**: For generating initial drafts
2. **Code Analysis AI**: For extracting documentation from code
3. **Jekyll + GitHub Pages**: For automated publishing
4. **Custom Prompts**: For consistent formatting and style

### Process Designed
1. Extract key information from code/requirements
2. Use AI to generate structured documentation drafts
3. Review and refine the AI-generated content
4. Publish through automated Jekyll workflow
5. Maintain through AI-assisted updates

## Results So Far

### Positive Outcomes
- **Speed**: 60-70% faster initial documentation creation
- **Consistency**: AI maintains consistent tone and structure
- **Comprehensiveness**: AI rarely misses important sections
- **Code Examples**: Automatically generates relevant examples

### Challenges Encountered
- **Context Limitations**: Large codebases require chunking
- **Technical Accuracy**: Still needs human verification
- **Customization**: Generic outputs need personalization
- **Learning Curve**: Prompt engineering takes time to master

## Key Learnings

### Effective Prompting Strategies
1. **Structured Templates**: Use consistent formats for different doc types
2. **Context Priming**: Always provide background and audience info
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Build documentation in stages
4. **Example-Driven**: Include examples of desired output format

### Best Practices Discovered
- Start with AI for structure, then add human expertise
- Use AI for tedious formatting and consistency tasks
- Maintain human oversight for technical accuracy
- Create reusable prompt templates for common doc types

### Tools Integration
- Jekyll collections work well for categorized content
- GitHub Actions can automate AI-assisted updates
- Version control allows tracking of AI vs human contributions
- Markdown provides good balance of structure and simplicity

## Current Status

The experiment is ongoing with these active developments:

1. **Template Refinement**: Improving prompt templates based on usage
2. **Automation Pipeline**: Building GitHub Actions for doc updates
3. **Quality Metrics**: Developing ways to measure doc effectiveness
4. **User Feedback**: Collecting feedback on AI-generated docs

## Next Steps

### Short Term (Next Month)
- [ ] Finalize the core prompt templates
- [ ] Set up automated quality checks
- [ ] Create user feedback collection system
- [ ] Document the complete workflow process

### Medium Term (Next Quarter)
- [ ] Integrate with code review process
- [ ] Experiment with multi-language documentation
- [ ] Build custom AI tools for specific documentation tasks
- [ ] Measure impact on developer productivity

### Long Term (Next Year)
- [ ] Open source the complete workflow system
- [ ] Develop training materials for other teams
- [ ] Research advanced AI capabilities for documentation
- [ ] Build community around AI-assisted documentation

## Lessons for Future Projects

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic AI assistance, add complexity gradually
2. **Human-AI Collaboration**: Best results come from combining AI speed with human expertise
3. **Process Documentation**: Document the AI workflow itself for reproducibility
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Regular refinement of prompts and processes is essential
5. **Quality Gates**: Maintain quality standards despite automation
