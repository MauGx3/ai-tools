We all know the basics of Vibe Coding, keep prompts simple, move fast, and trust the AI. But what happens when you hit a wall on a complex feature? Iâ€™ve gathered a few techniques that worked well for me and thought to share here as well. Hopefully, this saves some of your time, tokens, and headaches.

## [Top Advanced Vibe Coding Best Practices:](https://vibe.forem.com/aisuperhub/10-next-level-vibe-coding-techniques-i-wish-i-knew-earlier-34pm#top-advanced-vibe-coding-best-practices)

**The "Negative Constraint" Prompt** - Sometimes telling the AI what _not_ to do is clearer than telling it what _to_ do. (e.g., "Do not use Redux for state management. Use local state hooks only.")

**The "What's Missing?" Prompt** - If the output seems functional but incomplete, ask: "Given this function and the goal to \[X\], what documentation, error handling, or security checks are currently missing?"

**Templatize Repetitive Prompts** - Create a simple text template for common tasks (like creating a new API handler or a component). Copy-paste the template and just fill in the variables.

**Micro-Prompt Chaining** - Instead of one giant prompt, break a feature into 3-5 tiny, sequential prompts. Each one uses the output of the previous one (e.g., "Step 1: Write the Function Signature. Step 2: Implement the Core Logic. Step 3: Add Unit Tests.").

**The "Style Guide" Injection** - Before you ask for code, quickly paste a small, representative snippet of your _existing_ code (e.g., a styled component or a helper function). This instantly locks the AI into your project's "vibe" and style.

**Error-as-Context Refinement** - When you get an error, paste the **entire error traceback** back to the AI. Ask it to fix the code _and_ explain the root cause. This cuts debugging time in half and prevents recursive errors.

**Version-Aware Prompting** - Always specify the exact library and version (e.g., "React 18 functional component using TypeScript 5.2"). Ambiguity is the enemy of a good vibe.

**Multi-File Context Strategy** - Don't dump a whole codebase. Instead, provide a file path and a 5-line summary for 3-4 adjacent files. The AI gets the architectural vibe without massive token usage.

**Force "Code Only" Mode** - For final execution steps, explicitly state: "Only output the code block. Do not include any explanation, headers, or surrounding prose." This is crucial for pipeline automation.

**Visual Vibe Prompting** - For UI elements, use descriptive visual language instead of technical jargon: "Make the button feel 'soft' and 'welcoming' with a subtle shadow and primary brand color."
