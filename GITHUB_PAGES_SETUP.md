# 🚀 GitHub Pages Setup Guide

## Current Status: ⚠️ Pages Not Enabled

Your GitHub Pages site is **not currently deployed** because GitHub Pages is not enabled in the repository settings.

## Quick Fix (5 minutes)

Follow these steps to enable GitHub Pages and deploy your site:

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages (Requires Admin Access)

1. Go to your repository: **https://github.com/MauGx3/ai-tools**
2. Click the **Settings** tab
3. Click **Pages** in the left sidebar
4. Under **Build and deployment**:
   - **Source**: Select **"GitHub Actions"** from the dropdown
5. Click **Save**

### 2. Wait for Automatic Deployment

After enabling Pages:

- GitHub Actions will automatically trigger a new workflow run
- Go to the **Actions** tab to monitor progress
- Wait for "Build and deploy Jekyll site to GitHub Pages" to complete
- The workflow should now include a successful "deploy" job

### 3. Access Your Site

Once deployed, your site will be live at:

**🌐 https://maugx3.github.io/ai-tools/**

## Verify Everything Works

After deployment, run the verification script:

```bash
bash .github/scripts/verify-pages.sh
```

This will test all 24 pages and confirm they're accessible.

## What's Already Working ✅

- ✅ Jekyll site builds successfully
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow is properly configured
- ✅ All content and pages are generated correctly
- ✅ Site structure is valid
- ✅ Navigation and links are properly configured

## What Needs to Be Done ❌

- ❌ Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings (Step 1 above)
- ❌ Wait for first deployment to complete
- ❌ Verify site is accessible

## Understanding the Current Workflow

The GitHub Actions workflow is smart and handles the situation gracefully:

1. **Build Step**: Always runs and builds the Jekyll site ✅
2. **Check**: Detects if GitHub Pages is enabled
3. **Upload**: If Pages is NOT enabled:
   - Uploads site as a regular artifact (for preview)
   - Shows helpful warning message
   - Skips deployment
4. **Deploy**: If Pages IS enabled:
   - Uploads site as a Pages artifact
   - Deploys to GitHub Pages
   - Makes site publicly accessible

## Workflow Logs

In your current workflow runs, you'll see this message:

```
⚠️  GitHub Pages is not enabled for this repository.
📖 To enable GitHub Pages:
   1. Go to repository Settings
   2. Navigate to 'Pages' in the sidebar
   3. Under 'Source', select 'GitHub Actions'
   4. Save the settings
   5. Re-run this workflow

💡 This workflow will build the site but skip deployment until Pages is enabled.
```

## After Enabling Pages

Once you enable GitHub Pages, the next workflow run will:

1. Build the site (as before)
2. Detect Pages is enabled ✅
3. Upload as Pages artifact
4. **Deploy to GitHub Pages** ✨
5. Make your site live at https://maugx3.github.io/ai-tools/

## Testing

Comprehensive testing scripts are available in `.github/scripts/`:

- **`verify-pages.sh`**: Automated script that tests all 24 pages
- **`test-github-pages.md`**: Detailed manual test plan
- **`README.md`**: Full documentation on testing

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Deployment job shows as "skipped"
**Solution**: This is expected when Pages is not enabled. Follow Step 1 above.

### Issue: 404 errors on the site
**Solution**: 
1. Ensure Pages is enabled with "GitHub Actions" source
2. Wait for deployment workflow to complete
3. Check `_config.yml` has correct `baseurl: "/ai-tools"`

### Issue: Build fails
**Solution**:
1. Check Actions tab for specific error
2. Verify all files are committed
3. Check Gemfile for dependency issues

### Issue: Site loads but styling is broken
**Solution**:
1. Verify `baseurl` in `_config.yml` matches repository name
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check browser console for errors
