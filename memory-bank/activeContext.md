# Active Context

## Current Focus
Initialize Memory Bank and consolidate newly added Diátaxis documentation (tutorial, how-to, reference, explanation, try-it pages) with contributing guidelines.

## Recently Completed
- Added structured documentation pages under `docs/`
- Added CONTRIBUTING guide and PR helper script
- Began branch integration for documentation changes (rebasing & conflict resolution in progress previously)
- Memory Bank scaffolding created (this session)

## In Progress
- Finalizing branch rebase & PR (if not already completed externally)
- Planning automation around markdown linting & front matter validation

## Next Steps (Planned)
1. Confirm PR merged for documentation branch.
2. Add markdown link check CI workflow.
3. Introduce pytest scaffold for future script tests.
4. Add Memory Bank update checklist to PR template (future enhancement).

## Decisions (Recent)
- Chose to prioritize explicit Diátaxis segmentation for initial docs set.
- Accepted "theirs" versions of doc files during rebase to unify content (pending rebase completion if not already pushed).
- Established initial Memory Bank file schema exactly per instruction guidelines.

## Pending Questions
- Should we version scripts dependencies with a lock file? (Open)
- Add automated security scanning (e.g., `pip-audit`)? (Planned)

## Collaboration Signals
Contributors should update `progress.md` and this file (Active Context) when shifting focus areas or completing roadmap steps.
