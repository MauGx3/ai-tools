# TASK001 - Initialize Memory Bank

**Status:** Completed
**Added:** 2025-10-08
**Updated:** 2025-10-08

## Original Request
Initialize Memory Bank structure per `memory-bank.instructions.md` with core context files and tasks scaffolding.

## Thought Process
The repository lacks a persistent context directory. The Memory Bank enables stateless AI agents to regain context quickly. Core files defined by instructions: projectbrief, productContext, activeContext, systemPatterns, techContext, progress, tasks index. Need an initial task entry documenting this setup to seed history.

## Implementation Plan
- Create `memory-bank/` and `memory-bank/tasks/`
- Add each required core file with initial, accurate content
- Create `_index.md` and first task file
- Mark task complete

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%
