# Product Context

The AI Tools Collection acts as a curated operational knowledge base for AI-assisted development workflows. It enables:
- Faster prompt discovery & reuse
- Consistent documentation and process enforcement
- Reproducible automation examples (e.g., GitHub starred repo analysis)

## Problems Addressed
| Problem | Solution Provided |
|---------|-------------------|
| Fragmented prompts/instructions | Centralized structured folders with metadata |
| Loss of agent session context | Memory Bank persistence files |
| Inconsistent PR / commit discipline | CONTRIBUTING and Conventional Commits guidance |
| Onboarding friction | Diátaxis tutorial & how-to docs |

## Target Users
- Maintainers: evolve instruction sets & docs
- Contributors: add prompts, modes, guides
- Automated agents: apply rules using `applyTo` logic

## User Experience Goals
- Low cognitive load—predictable folder semantics
- Fast orientation (repo structure reference + getting started tutorial)
- Clear contribution path with checklists and commit guidance

## Differentiators
- Integrated Memory Bank strategy
- Security-first instruction overlays (OWASP-focused)
- Explicit separation of tutorial vs how-to vs reference vs explanation

## Value Proposition
Improve reliability and reusability of AI-assisted workflows while preserving decision history and architectural rationale across stateless agent interactions.
