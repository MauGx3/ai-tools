# Project Brief

**Project Name:** AI Tools Collection
**Primary Purpose:** Centralized, structured repository for AI prompts, instructions, modes, documentation, and supporting automation scripts.
**Core Goal:** Provide a reproducible, extensible knowledge/workflow hub for AI-assisted software development and documentation, using Diátaxis-aligned docs and Memory Bank persistence.

## Objectives
1. Curate high-quality prompts and instruction sets with explicit applyTo scoping.
2. Maintain robust documentation (tutorial, how-to, reference, explanation) aligned to Diátaxis.
3. Offer automation scripts (e.g., starred repository scanner, recommender) as practical examples.
4. Enable consistent agent collaboration via explicit conventions (Conventional Commits, security, testing, memory updates).
5. Persist project knowledge across stateless AI sessions via a Memory Bank.

## Success Criteria
- Clear onboarding: new contributor can run a script in <10 minutes.
- Documentation discoverable via site navigation & docs index.
- Each substantial change updates relevant Memory Bank files.
- Automated or manual PR review standards enforce security, style, and commit format.

## Non-Goals (Current)
- Building a hosted SaaS product.
- Implementing complex backend services or databases.
- Managing sensitive production secrets (should remain external to repo).

## Stakeholders
- Repository maintainer(s)
- External contributors
- Automated AI agents operating under instruction policies

## High-Level Scope
Content, automation scripts, and structured instructions—NOT a monolithic application. Emphasis on clarity, maintainability, auditability.
