## Awesome AI Tools
A curated list of awesome AI tools and resources. This does not aim to replace or supersede other lists, and are my personal choices. I have not tried all of these tools, so please do your own research before using them.

Any suggestions or additions are welcome, please open an issue or a pull request.

### GitHub Repositories

### Cursor, Claude Code, Index and More
- [void](https://github.com/voideditor/void): Open-source Cursor alternative. Use AI agents on your codebase, checkpoint and visualize changes, and bring any model or host locally. Void sends messages directly to providers without retaining your data.
