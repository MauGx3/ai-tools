This tutorial helps a new contributor or user get the repository running locally and run the primary scripts (a small starred-repository scanner and recommender) so you can inspect results quickly.

Audience: new contributors and users (novice-to-intermediate developers)

What you'll achieve
- Install the project dependencies
- Run the main scanner script and inspect the output

Prerequisites
- macOS, Linux, or WSL on Windows
- Python 3.10+ (3.11 recommended)
- Git

Install steps

1. Clone the repository

```fish
git clone https://github.com/MauGx3/ai-tools.git
cd ai-tools
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)

```fish
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate.fish
```

3. Install Python dependencies

The repository keeps Python requirements for scripts inside `scripts/requirements.txt`.

```fish
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
```

Run the scanner (quick smoke test)

This project contains example scripts under `scripts/`.

```fish
python scripts/scan_starred_repos.py --help
# or
python scripts/repo_recommender.py --help
```

Expectations
- The `--help` output lists available options.
- When run with defaults, scripts will write results to `scripts/results/` or `results/` (check script docstrings/comments).

Troubleshooting
- If Python packages fail to install, upgrade pip: `pip install -U pip`.
- If you see permission errors, ensure the virtualenv is activated and you are not using a system Python with restricted write access.
- If a script references environment variables, see `docs/explain/design-and-memory-bank.md` for guidance about secrets and secure configuration.

Next steps
- Read the Howâ€‘to guide: "Add a prompt or instruction" to learn how to contribute new prompts and instruction files.
- See the Reference for a concise repo structure and important files.
