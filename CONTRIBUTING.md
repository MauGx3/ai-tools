## Contributing

1. Fork the repository and create a branch with a descriptive name.

2. Follow Conventional Commits for commit messages. Example:

```
feat(prompts): add my-new-prompt.md
```

3. Add or update documentation when you change behavior, including Memory Bank updates where relevant.

4. Security: never commit secrets. If your change requires secrets to run, document required environment variables in the README or the specific instruction file.

5. Tests: run existing tests and add new tests when applicable.

6. Open a PR and include a clear description, testing steps, and the proposed commit message in the PR body.
